    <h2>Technical Calls</h2>
    <p>
        Oftentimes, it's the technical advice that can make the most difference. How the boat feels and where it can improve usually correlates to technique. Here are a few technical call ideas, focusing on specific parts of the stroke:
    </p>

    <h3>The Catch</h3>
    <p>
        The catch is when the blade enters the water, setting up the stroke. Here's a breakdown of the catch position:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Legs at a 90˚ angle to the bottom of the boat (vertical position).</li>
        <li>Arms should be fully extended but not tight.</li>
        <li>Inside shoulder leans slightly into the rigger for better stability.</li>
        <li>Outside hand should be slightly further out than the inside hand due to lateral rotation around the pin.</li>
        <li>Heels should hover off the foot stretchers, ready for the drive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common calls for the catch might include:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>“Catch it!”</li>
        <li>“Catch, full reach!”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Drive</h3>
    <p>
        During the drive, the blade is in the water, and the rower slides from stern to bow. Here's a breakdown of the drive:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>The legs account for approximately 70% of the power.</li>
        <li>The body contributes around 20%, with the arms making up the remaining 10%.</li>
        <li>Engage the lats and core for the swing, rather than relying on the shoulders.</li>
        <li>The body should swing from around 1 o'clock to 11 o'clock.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common calls for the drive might include:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>“Drive with the legs!”</li>
        <li>“Power through the core!”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Finish</h3>
    <p>
        The finish occurs when the blade is ready to come out of the water. The body should be positioned like this:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Body around 11 o'clock, with the core engaged to hold the position.</li>
        <li>The back should be tall and relaxed.</li>
        <li>Legs extended, with heels pressed against the footplate.</li>
        <li>The handle should be near the mid-ribs, or sports bra.</li>
        <li>The elbow should be about the same height as the handle at the release.</li>
        <li>At the release (when the blade comes out of the water), the blade should not be feathered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common calls for the finish might include:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>“Finish strong!”</li>
        <li>“Hold the finish!”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Recovery</h3>
    <p>
        The recovery is when the blade is off the water and moving from bow to stern. Here's how to execute the recovery:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Arms move first, followed by the body and then the legs.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the hands clear the knees before the legs begin to move.</li>
        <li>The upper body should pivot over the hips as the rower prepares for the next stroke.</li>
        <li>The slide should be quiet — loud recovery tracks indicate rushing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common calls for the recovery might include:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px; line-height: 2;">
        <li>“Long and strong recovery!”</li>
        <li>“Quiet slide!”</li>
    </ul>
